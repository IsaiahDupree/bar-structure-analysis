# Working Directory

This directory contains auxiliary and development files for the Bar Structure Analysis project. These are secondary files and experimental versions that are not part of the main clean implementation.

## Contents

- Various experimental and development versions of the MATLAB and Python scripts
- Alternative implementations and approaches
- Utility scripts for specialized tasks
- Deprecated or superseded files

## Usage

The files in this directory are not intended for direct use. They are maintained for reference, historical purposes, and potential future development.

For the main implementation:
- Use the files in the `/python/` directory for the Python implementation
- Use the files in the `/matlab/` directory for the MATLAB implementation

## Development

When working on new features or experimental approaches:

1. Copy the required files from the main directories to this working directory
2. Implement and test your changes here
3. Once validated, copy the finalized files back to the appropriate main directory
