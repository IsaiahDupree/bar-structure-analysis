Bar Structure Analysis Report
===========================

Problem Parameters:
- A1 = 200 mm², A2 = 100 mm², A3 = 50 mm²
- E1 = 130.0 GPa, E2 = 200.0 GPa
- L = 500 mm
- F1 = 20.0 kN, F2 = 40.0 kN, F3 = 20.0 kN

Finite Element Analysis:
- Number of elements per segment: 4
- Total number of elements: 12
- Element type: 2-node linear elements

Results:
- Plots and visualizations have been saved in the 'plots' directory
- See stress_field.png for stress distribution
- See displacement_field.png for displacement distribution
- See error.png for error analysis

Methodology:
1. Analytical solution calculated for exact stress distribution
2. Finite element method applied with 2-node elements
3. Element stiffness matrices calculated and assembled
4. System solved for nodal displacements
5. Element stresses computed from displacements
6. Error analysis performed to validate results

Analysis:
- The mesh was refined until the error was below 5%
- Stress concentration is observed at segment transitions
- The maximum displacement occurs at the right end of the bar
