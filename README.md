## Problem Descriptions

### Problem 1: Three 2-Node Elements
Analysis of a structure with three 2-node elements:
- Shape functions for all three elements
- Displacements at 両 = 0.5
- Strains at 両 = 0.5
- Stiffness matrix calculation using Gauss integration

### Problem 2: Two 3-Node Elements
Analysis of a structure with two 3-node elements:
- Shape functions for both elements
- Displacements at 両 = -0.5
- Strains at 両 = -0.5
- Stiffness matrix calculation using numerical integration

## Implementation Details

The implementations follow a systematic approach:
1. Define shape functions for each element type
2. Calculate displacements at specified positions
3. Calculate strains at specified positions
4. Compute element stiffness matrices
5. Visualize results

Both Python and MATLAB implementations provide equivalent functionality with visualization capabilities.

## Reports

Multiple report formats are available:
- LaTeX documents with mathematical typesetting
