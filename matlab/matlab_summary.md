# Bar Structure Analysis - MATLAB Implementation

This directory contains the results of the bar structure analysis performed using MATLAB, matching the Python implementation exactly. The MATLAB implementation produces identical visualizations and documentation as the Python version.

## Problem Parameters
- A1 = 200 mm², A2 = 100 mm², A3 = 50 mm²
- E1 = 130.0 GPa, E2 = 200.0 GPa
- L = 500 mm
- F1 = 20.0 kN, F2 = 40.0 kN, F3 = 20.0 kN

## Generated Visualizations
The MATLAB implementation generates the following visualizations:

1. **Displacement Field** (`enhanced_displacement_field.png`)
   - Shows the axial displacement along the bar
   - Compares analytical solution with FEM results
   - Includes detailed annotations for segments and material properties

2. **Stress Field** (`enhanced_stress_field.png`)
   - Shows the axial stress distribution along the bar
   - Includes force arrows and segment annotations
   - Highlights constant vs. varying stress regions

3. **Area Distribution** (`enhanced_area_distribution.png`)
   - Visualizes how cross-sectional area changes along the bar
   - Labels the different segment types and dimensions
   - Shows material property annotations

4. **Combined Visualization** (`enhanced_combined_visualization.png`)
   - Shows a schematic diagram of the composite bar structure
   - Includes force arrows and support symbols
   - Combines stress and displacement plots for comprehensive analysis

## Report Files
- `detailed_analysis.md` - Contains answers to the 8 main analysis questions
- `enhanced_bar_analysis_report.txt` - Comprehensive technical report

## Implementation Features
The MATLAB implementation matches the Python version with:

1. Accurate internal force calculations based on equilibrium
2. Proper stress and displacement fields with correct boundary conditions
3. Enhanced visualizations with detailed annotations
4. Comprehensive documentation addressing all 8 key questions

All files were generated to be identical to the Python implementation, allowing for direct comparison between the two versions.
