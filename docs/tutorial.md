# Bar Structure Analysis Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to use both Python and MATLAB implementations of the finite element method (FEM) to analyze a composite bar structure. Both implementations solve the same problem but offer complementary advantages for educational and practical purposes.

## Problem Description

We are analyzing a composite bar structure with the following characteristics:

- The bar consists of three segments, each of length L.
- Each segment has different properties:
  - Segment 1: Variable cross-sectional area from A₁ to A₂, elastic modulus E₁
  - Segment 2: Constant cross-sectional area A₂, elastic modulus E₁
  - Segment 3: Constant cross-sectional area A₃, elastic modulus E₂
- Forces are applied at the ends of each segment: F₁, F₂, and F₃
- The left end of the bar is fixed

## Parameters Used in the Analysis

The analysis uses the following parameters:

- A₁ = 200 mm²
- A₂ = 100 mm²
- A₃ = 50 mm²
- E₁ = 130 GPa
- E₂ = 200 GPa
- L = 500 mm
- F₁ = 20 kN
- F₂ = 40 kN
- F₃ = 20 kN

## Understanding the Code

The implementation is divided into several files:

### main.py

This is the entry point that runs the analysis. It:
- Defines the problem parameters
- Creates the BarAnalysis object
- Runs the analytical solution and FEM analysis
- Refines the mesh until errors are below 5%
- Generates plots and reports

### bar_analysis.py

This contains the main `BarAnalysis` class with methods to:
- Solve the problem analytically
- Solve using finite element method (FEM)
- Calculate stresses and displacements
- Compare analytical and FEM solutions
- Plot results and generate reports

### utils.py

Contains utility functions for:
- Linear interpolation
- Plotting with proper formatting
- Creating reports

## Engineering Approach to Finite Element Analysis

Our FEM implementation rigorously follows these eight fundamental engineering steps:

### 1. Partitioning the Structure into Elements

- The bar is divided into discrete elements (initially 4 elements per segment, 12 total)
- Element size determined systematically: L_element = L_segment / number_of_elements_per_segment
- Nodes created at element boundaries with sequential global numbering
- Node coordinates calculated based on their position along the bar length

### 2. Assigning Material and Geometric Properties

- Material properties assigned based on segment position:
  - Elements in segments 1 and 2: E₁ = 130 GPa
  - Elements in segment 3: E₂ = 200 GPa

- Geometric properties precisely defined for each element:
  - Segment 1: Linearly varying cross-section from A₁ = 200 mm² to A₂ = 100 mm²
  - Segment 2: Constant cross-section A₂ = 100 mm²
  - Segment 3: Constant cross-section A₃ = 50 mm²
  - Cross-sectional area evaluated at the element midpoint for elements in segment 1

### 3. Assembling the Global Stiffness Matrix

- Element stiffness matrices derived from structural mechanics principles:
  - k_element = (A·E/L) * [1 -1; -1 1]
  - Derived from the weak form of the equilibrium equation: d/dx[EA·du/dx] = 0

- Global assembly procedure follows standard FEM methodology:
  - Initialize global stiffness matrix K of size n×n (n = number of nodes)
  - For each element e with nodes i and j:

    ```python
    K[i,i] += k_element[0,0]
    K[i,j] += k_element[0,1]
    K[j,i] += k_element[1,0]
    K[j,j] += k_element[1,1]
    ```

### 4. Applying Boundary Conditions and Forces

- Essential (displacement) boundary conditions:
  - Fixed left end: u₁ = 0
  - Implemented by eliminating first row and column from global system

- Natural (force) boundary conditions:
  - Forces applied at segment interfaces: F₁ = 20 kN, F₂ = 40 kN, F₃ = 20 kN
  - Force vector F constructed with forces placed at appropriate degrees of freedom
  - Engineering sign convention: tensile forces positive, compressive forces negative

### 5. Solving for Nodal Displacements

- Modified system of equations after boundary conditions: K_reduced · U_reduced = F_reduced
- Direct solution method employing efficient numerical techniques:

  ```python
  U_reduced = scipy.linalg.solve(K_reduced, F_reduced)
  ```
- Complete displacement vector reconstructed with fixed boundary values
- Solution verified for physical reasonability (e.g., maximum displacement at free end)

### 6. Calculating Element Stresses

- Stress calculations based on fundamental mechanics relationships:
  - Strain computation: ε = (u₂ - u₁)/L
  - Stress derived from constitutive law: σ = E·ε
  - Implemented as: σ_element = E_element · (u₂ - u₁)/L_element

- Stress results verified against engineering expectations:
  - Stress inversely proportional to cross-sectional area
  - Stress constant within elements (first-order approximation)
  - Maximum stress occurring in smallest cross-section element

### 7. Comparing with Analytical Solution

- Rigorous error assessment methodology:
  - Analytical solution derived from exact integration of governing equation
  - FEM stresses interpolated to comparison points (element centers)
  - Relative percentage error calculated: ε = |(σ_fem - σ_analytical)/σ_analytical| × 100%
  - Error metrics computed: maximum error, average error, error distribution

### 8. Refining Mesh Based on Error

- Adaptive refinement strategy implemented:
  - Error threshold established at 5%
  - If maximum error exceeds threshold, mesh is systematically refined
  - Number of elements doubled in each refinement cycle
  - Refinement continues until convergence criteria are satisfied:
    1. Error falls below threshold, or
    2. Maximum refinement iterations reached
  - Convergence rates analyzed to validate implementation

## Analytical Solution

The analytical solution calculates:
- Stress distribution along the bar: σ(x) = F/A(x)
- Displacement by integration: u(x) = ∫[F/(A(x)·E(x))]dx

## Running the Code

### Python Implementation

The Python implementation is modular, object-oriented, and uses NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for numerical operations and visualization.

## Interpretation of Results

When analyzing the results, pay attention to:

1. **Stress discontinuities** at segment boundaries due to changes in area
2. **Error distribution** - higher errors typically occur at segment transitions
3. **Convergence behavior** - how the error decreases with mesh refinement
4. **Maximum displacement** at the right end of the bar

## Extending the Code

This implementation can be extended in several ways:

1. **Add 3-node elements** for higher accuracy
2. **Implement other material models** (non-linear, etc.)
3. **Add dynamic analysis capabilities**
4. **Create a graphical user interface** for parameter input
5. **Extend to 2D and 3D problems**

## Mathematical Background

The governing equation for a bar element is:

d/dx[EA·du/dx] = 0

Where:
- E = elastic modulus
- A = cross-sectional area
- u = displacement

This is derived from:
- Force equilibrium: dF/dx = 0
- Constitutive law: σ = E·ε
- Strain definition: ε = du/dx

## Benefits of Dual Implementation

Having both Python and MATLAB implementations offers several benefits:

### Educational Value

1. **Comparative Learning**: Students can compare implementations in two popular engineering languages
2. **Algorithm Understanding**: Seeing the same solution in different languages reinforces the algorithm's concepts

   ```python
   # Python
   array[0] # First element
   ```

   ```matlab
   % MATLAB
   array(1) % First element
   ```


2. **Matrix Operations**:

   ```python
   # Python (NumPy)
   np.dot(A, B)  # Matrix multiplication
   ```

   % MATLAB
   A * B  % Matrix multiplication
   ```


3. **Plotting**:

   ```python
   # Python (Matplotlib)
   plt.figure()
   plt.plot(x, y)
   plt.xlabel('x')
   plt.ylabel('y')
   plt.title('Plot')
   plt.savefig('plot.png')
   ```

   ```matlab
   % MATLAB
   figure
   plot(x, y)
   xlabel('x')
   ylabel('y')
   title('Plot')
   saveas(gcf, 'plot.png')
   ```


## Troubleshooting

### Python Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Plot Directory Issues**:
   If plots aren't being saved, ensure the `plots` directory exists:


   ```bash
   mkdir plots
   ```


3. **Memory Issues**:
   For large meshes, you might encounter memory problems. Reduce `num_elements_per_segment` in `main.py`.

### MATLAB Troubleshooting

1. **Path Issues**:
   Make sure all .m files are in the MATLAB path:


   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath('.'));
   ```


2. **Version Compatibility**:
   The code is designed to work with MATLAB R2016b and newer.

3. **Figure Display Issues**:
   If figures aren't displaying properly:


   ```matlab
   close all;
   figure('Visible', 'on');
   ```
