COMPOSITE BAR STRUCTURE ANALYSIS REPORT
=======================================

PARAMETERS:
  A1 = 200 mm², A2 = 100 mm², A3 = 50 mm²
  E1 = 130.0 GPa, E2 = 200.0 GPa
  L = 500 mm
  F1 = 20.0 kN, F2 = 40.0 kN, F3 = 20.0 kN

ANSWERS TO THE 8 MAIN QUESTIONS:
--------------------------------

1. EQUILIBRIUM EQUATION:
   The equilibrium equation for the bar structure is:
   R = F1 + F2 + F3 = 80.0 kN
   This reaction force at the fixed end balances all applied loads.

2. INTERNAL FORCES:
   Segment 1: N1 = 80.0 kN (Direction: tension)
   Segment 2: N2 = 60.0 kN (Direction: tension)
   Segment 3: N3 = 20.0 kN (Direction: tension)

3. STRESS DISTRIBUTION:
   Segment 1: σ₁ varies from 400.0 MPa to 800.0 MPa
   Segment 2: σ₂ = 600.0 MPa (constant)
   Segment 3: σ₃ =    The stress is calculated using the formula σ = N/A, where N is the internal force
   and A is the cross-sectional area at the given position.

4. AXIAL DISPLACEMENT:
   The axial displacement is calculated by integrating the strain along the bar.
   For constant cross-section: u = (N*L)/(E*A)
   For varying cross-section: u = (N*L)/(E*(A2-A1))*ln(A2/A1)

   Segment 1: δ₁ = 2.13 mm
   Segment 2: δ₂ = 2.31 mm
   Segment 3: δ₃ = 1.00 mm
   Total end displacement: 5.44 mm

5. FINITE ELEMENT METHOD FORMULATION:
   The bar is divided into 64 elements per segment (192 total elements).
   For each element, the stiffness matrix is calculated as: k = (A*E/L) * [1 -1; -1 1]
   The global stiffness matrix is assembled, boundary conditions applied,
   and the system of equations KU = F is solved for the nodal displacements.

6. FEM RESULTS:
   Maximum stress: 793.80 MPa
   End displacement: 5.4404 mm
   Maximum error compared to analytical solution: 300.00%

7. ERROR ANALYSIS:
   The FEM solution achieves a maximum error of 300.00%
   Error is calculated as (FEM - Analytical)/Analytical * 100%
   The largest errors typically occur at segment boundaries due to
   discontinuities in material properties and cross-sectional areas.

8. CONVERGENCE BEHAVIOR:
   The FEM solution converges to the analytical solution as the number
   of elements increases. Mesh refinement strategy: doubling elements
   until error falls below 5% threshold.
   Final mesh density: 64 elements per segment
