**Extracting text from images**

The user provided two images and wants the textual content extracted from them. Based on the description, it looks like they want text from the problem set. I'll need to extract text from the images, but since the necessary OCR libraries aren't available, I can't directly process them using code. I could manually transcribe the text from the images, though I’m not sure how precise that would be. I'll take a closer look at them and figure out how best to transcribe the problem statement manually.

**Problem 1**

See below the structure consisting of **three 2‑node elements**.
The displacements at nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are **1, 3, 4 and 6**.

1. Derive shape functions for all three elements.
2. Use the reference element to find the displacements in each element at **ξ = 0.5**.
3. Use the reference element to find the strains in each element at **ξ = 0.5**.
4. Calculate the stiffness matrix of all elements using **Gauss integration of the reference element**.

*(The line of nodes is at x = 0, 2, 4, 6 with elements ①, ②, ③ between them.)*

**Problem 2**

See below the structure consisting of **two 3‑node elements**.
The displacements at nodes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are **0, –1, 2, –1 and 4**.

1. Derive shape functions for both elements.
2. Use the reference element to find the displacements in each element at **ξ = –0.5**.
3. Use the reference element to find the strains in each element at **ξ = –0.5**.
4. Calculate the stiffness matrix of all elements using the reference element with integration points **ξ = –0.5** and **ξ = 0.5**.

*(The line of nodes is at x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 with elements ① and ② covering nodes 1‑3 and 3‑5 respectively.)*
