# Bar Structure Analysis Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to use both Python and MATLAB implementations of the finite element method (FEM) to analyze a composite bar structure. Both implementations solve the same problem but offer complementary advantages for educational and practical purposes.

## Problem Description

We are analyzing a composite bar structure with the following characteristics:

- The bar consists of three segments, each of length L.
- Each segment has different properties:
  - Segment 1: Variable cross-sectional area from A₁ to A₂, elastic modulus E₁
  - Segment 2: Constant cross-sectional area A₂, elastic modulus E₁
  - Segment 3: Constant cross-sectional area A₃, elastic modulus E₂
- Forces are applied at the ends of each segment: F₁, F₂, and F₃
- The left end of the bar is fixed

## Parameters Used in the Analysis

The analysis uses the following parameters:

- A₁ = 200 mm²
- A₂ = 100 mm²
- A₃ = 50 mm²
- E₁ = 130 GPa
- E₂ = 200 GPa
- L = 500 mm
- F₁ = 20 kN
- F₂ = 40 kN
- F₃ = 20 kN

## Understanding the Code

The implementation is divided into several files:

### main.py

This is the entry point that runs the analysis. It:
- Defines the problem parameters
- Creates the BarAnalysis object
- Runs the analytical solution and FEM analysis
- Refines the mesh until errors are below 5%
- Generates plots and reports

### bar_analysis.py

This contains the main `BarAnalysis` class with methods to:
- Solve the problem analytically
- Solve using finite element method (FEM)
- Calculate stresses and displacements
- Compare analytical and FEM solutions
- Plot results and generate reports

### utils.py

Contains utility functions for:
- Linear interpolation
- Plotting with proper formatting
- Creating reports

## Step-by-Step Finite Element Analysis

The FEM implementation follows these steps:

1. **Partition the structure into elements**
   - The bar is divided into a number of finite elements
   - Element size = L / number_of_elements_per_segment

2. **Element Type**
   - 2-node linear elements are used
   - Each element has two nodes with one degree of freedom (displacement) per node

3. **Element Stiffness Matrix Calculation**
   - For each element, a 2×2 stiffness matrix is calculated:
   - k = (A·E/L) * [1 -1; -1 1]
   - A = cross-sectional area
   - E = elastic modulus
   - L = element length

4. **Global Matrix Assembly**
   - Element stiffness matrices are assembled into a global stiffness matrix
   - Global force vector is populated with applied forces

5. **Boundary Conditions**
   - Fixed displacement at the left end (x=0)
   - Implementation: first row and column of the global matrix are removed

6. **Solution**
   - The system of equations KU = F is solved for nodal displacements
   - U = K⁻¹F, where K is the stiffness matrix and F is the force vector

7. **Post-processing**
   - Element stresses are calculated from nodal displacements
   - Stress = E * (u₂ - u₁)/L
   - Results are compared with the analytical solution

## Analytical Solution

The analytical solution calculates:
- Stress distribution along the bar: σ(x) = F/A(x)
- Displacement by integration: u(x) = ∫[F/(A(x)·E(x))]dx

## Running the Code

### Python Implementation

The Python implementation is modular, object-oriented, and uses NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for numerical operations and visualization.

#### Prerequisites

1. Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The requirements include:

   - NumPy
   - SciPy
   - Matplotlib
   - python-docx (for generating Word document reports)

#### Running the Basic Analysis

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Calculate the analytical solution
2. Perform the FEM analysis with an initial mesh
3. Refine the mesh until the error is below the specified tolerance
4. Generate plots for displacements, stresses, and errors
5. Create a simple text report

#### Running the Enhanced Analysis

```bash
python enhanced_main.py
```

The enhanced version provides:
1. More detailed output in the terminal
2. Structured presentation of analytical results
3. Thorough error analysis
4. Better control over the mesh refinement

#### Generating a Comprehensive Report

```bash
python create_comprehensive_document.py
```

This will generate a detailed Word document (`Composite_Bar_Structure_Analysis_Report.docx`) containing:
1. Problem formulation and parameters
2. Detailed analytical solution
3. FEM implementation explanation
4. Comparative results with visualizations
5. Error analysis and conclusions
6. Code snippets for educational purposes

### MATLAB Implementation

The MATLAB implementation offers vector-based operations and visualization tools native to the MATLAB environment, which is often preferred in engineering education.

#### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (any recent version)
- No additional toolboxes required

#### Running the Analysis

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the bar_structure_analysis directory
2. Run the main script:
   ```matlab
   main_axial_bar
   ```
   Or alternatively, use the more detailed implementation:
   ```matlab
   main_bar_analysis
   ```

3. The scripts will:
   - Load input data from `inputData.m`
   - Generate the mesh using `generateMesh.m`
   - Solve the analytical solution using `solve_analytical.m`
   - Solve the FEM solution using `solveBar.m`
   - Display results using `displayAnalyticalSolution.m`
   - Create plots using `postPlots.m` and `errorPlot.m`
   - Generate a report using `generate_report.m`

#### Running from Command Line

If you prefer to run MATLAB in batch mode (useful for scripting):

```bash
matlab -batch "run('main_axial_bar.m')"
```

> Note: To use this command, MATLAB must be added to your system PATH.

## Output and Results

3. Saved plots and variables in the MATLAB workspace

## Interpretation of Results

When analyzing the results, pay attention to:

1. **Stress discontinuities** at segment boundaries due to changes in area
2. **Error distribution** - higher errors typically occur at segment transitions
3. **Convergence behavior** - how the error decreases with mesh refinement
4. **Maximum displacement** at the right end of the bar

## Extending the Code

This implementation can be extended in several ways:

1. **Add 3-node elements** for higher accuracy
2. **Implement other material models** (non-linear, etc.)
3. **Add dynamic analysis capabilities**
4. **Create a graphical user interface** for parameter input
5. **Extend to 2D and 3D problems**

## Mathematical Background

The governing equation for a bar element is:

d/dx[EA·du/dx] = 0

Where:
- E = elastic modulus
- A = cross-sectional area
- u = displacement

This is derived from:
- Force equilibrium: dF/dx = 0
- Constitutive law: σ = E·ε
- Strain definition: ε = du/dx

## Benefits of Dual Implementation

Having both Python and MATLAB implementations offers several benefits:

### Educational Value

1. **Comparative Learning**: Students can compare implementations in two popular engineering languages
2. **Algorithm Understanding**: Seeing the same solution in different languages reinforces the algorithm's concepts

   ```python
   # Python
   array[0] # First element
   ```

   ```matlab
   % MATLAB
   array(1) % First element
   ```

2. **Matrix Operations**:

   ```python
   # Python (NumPy)
   np.dot(A, B)  # Matrix multiplication
   ```

   ```matlab
   % MATLAB
   A * B  % Matrix multiplication
   ```

3. **Plotting**:

   ```python
   # Python (Matplotlib)
   plt.figure()
   plt.plot(x, y)
   plt.xlabel('x')
   plt.ylabel('y')
   plt.title('Plot')
   plt.savefig('plot.png')
   ```

   ```matlab
   % MATLAB
   figure
   plot(x, y)
   xlabel('x')
   ylabel('y')
   title('Plot')
   saveas(gcf, 'plot.png')
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Python Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Plot Directory Issues**:
   If plots aren't being saved, ensure the `plots` directory exists:

   ```bash
   mkdir plots
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**:
   For large meshes, you might encounter memory problems. Reduce `num_elements_per_segment` in `main.py`.

### MATLAB Troubleshooting

1. **Path Issues**:
   Make sure all .m files are in the MATLAB path:

   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath('.'));
   ```

2. **Version Compatibility**:
   The code is designed to work with MATLAB R2016b and newer.

3. **Figure Display Issues**:
   If figures aren't displaying properly:

   ```matlab
   close all;
   figure('Visible', 'on');
   ```
