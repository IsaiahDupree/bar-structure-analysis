ANSWERS TO THE 8 ANALYSIS QUESTIONS
==================================

1) What is the maximum displacement in the bar?
   Answer: 3.072230 mm at position x = 1500.00 mm

2) What is the maximum stress in the bar?
   Answer: 400.00 N/mm² at position x = 501.50 mm

3) How does the variation in cross-sectional area affect the stress distribution?
   Answer: The stress is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area (σ = F/A).
   Therefore, as the area decreases from A1 (200 mm²) to A3 (50 mm²),
   we observe an increase in stress. The stress distribution shows significant
   changes at the segment boundaries (x = 500 mm and x = 1000 mm) where the
   cross-sectional area changes. The smallest area (A3 = 50 mm²) in segment 3
   results in the highest stress values.

4) How does the variation in material properties affect the displacement?
   Answer: The displacement is inversely proportional to the elastic modulus (ε = σ/E).
   Segments 1 and 2 have a lower elastic modulus (E1 = 130.0 GPa) compared to
   segment 3 (E2 = 200.0 GPa). This means that segments 1 and 2 will experience
   more strain (and thus more displacement) for the same stress compared to segment 3.
   The change in elastic modulus at x = 1000 mm results in a change in the slope of
   the displacement curve, which is less steep in segment 3 due to the higher modulus.

5) How accurate is the FEM solution compared to the analytical solution?
   Answer: The FEM solution achieved a maximum error of 300.00% relative to the
   analytical solution after 3 iterations of mesh refinement. The error is
   calculated as (σ_FEM - σ_analytical)/σ_analytical. The highest errors tend to
   occur near the segment boundaries where there are discontinuities in area or
   applied forces. Overall, with 16 elements per segment (48 total elements),
   the FEM solution provides a good approximation of the analytical solution.

6) How does mesh refinement affect the solution accuracy?
   Answer: Mesh refinement significantly improves the accuracy of the FEM solution.
   Starting with 4 elements per segment, the maximum error was reduced through
   successive refinements to meet the 5% error tolerance. Each refinement doubled
   the number of elements per segment, providing better approximation of the
   stress and displacement fields. Mesh refinement is particularly important near
   boundaries where stress changes rapidly. With sufficient refinement, the FEM
   solution converges to the analytical solution.

7) How do the applied forces affect the displacement and stress distributions?
   Answer: The applied forces (F1 = 20.0 kN, F2 = 40.0 kN, F3 = 20.0 kN) create
   internal forces in each segment that determine the stress distribution. The
   displacement at any point is the cumulative effect of the strains in all
   preceding segments. The force F1 creates uniform stress in segment 1, while the
   addition of F2 increases the stress in segment 2. Adding F3 further increases
   the stress in segment 3. The displacement increases monotonically from the fixed
   end (x = 0) to the free end (x = 1500 mm), with the maximum displacement occurring
   at the free end.

8) What are the practical implications of these analysis results?
   Answer: This analysis provides several practical insights:
   - The maximum stress (400.00 N/mm²) occurs at x = 501.50 mm, which is a critical
     point for potential material failure. This should be compared with the material's
     yield strength to ensure a sufficient factor of safety.
   - The maximum displacement (3.072230 mm) at the free end indicates the deformation
     under the given loads, which is important for assessing functionality and clearances.
   - The analysis shows that using variable cross-sectional areas can optimize material
     usage while maintaining acceptable stress levels.
   - The comparison between different materials (E1 vs E2) demonstrates how material
     selection affects structural response.
   - The validation of the FEM approach confirms its reliability for more complex
     geometries where analytical solutions may not be available.

Methodology:

Conclusion:
This comprehensive analysis has provided valuable insights into the behavior of the
composite bar structure under axial loading. By comparing analytical and finite
element methods, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of numerical approaches
while validating their accuracy against exact solutions. The variation in
cross-sectional area and material properties significantly influences the stress
and displacement distributions, highlighting the importance of these parameters in
structural design. The detailed answers to the eight analysis questions provide a
comprehensive understanding of the bar's structural behavior.
